🛒 E-Commerce DevOps CI/CD Project
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a production-grade DevOps CI/CD pipeline for an e-commerce application using Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Argo CD.
The goal is to automate the entire application lifecycle—from code commit to live deployment—using GitOps best practices.

The pipeline ensures:

Fast and reliable deployments

Full traceability of releases

Secure handling of secrets

Declarative, version-controlled infrastructure

This setup mirrors real-world DevOps workflows used in modern cloud-native organizations.

🎯 Objectives

Containerize an e-commerce API using Docker

Automate builds and image publishing with GitHub Actions

Implement GitOps-based continuous delivery using Argo CD

Deploy and expose the application using Kubernetes

Maintain security, reliability, and rollback capability

Component Breakdown
1️⃣ GitHub Repository

Hosts application source code

Stores Kubernetes manifests

Acts as the single source of truth for deployments

2️⃣ GitHub Actions – Continuous Integration (CI)

On every push to the main branch:

Source code is checked out

A Docker image is built

Image is tagged with:

latest

Git commit SHA

Image is pushed to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

This ensures:

Immutable builds

Easy rollbacks

Deployment traceability

3️⃣ GitOps Manifest Update

After building the image:

The Kubernetes deployment manifest is updated with the new image tag

Changes are committed back to Git

This commit triggers Argo CD synchronization

No manual kubectl apply is required.

4️⃣ Argo CD – Continuous Delivery (CD)

Argo CD continuously watches the repository and:

Detects manifest changes

Pulls the updated desired state

Syncs Kubernetes resources automatically

This enables:

Declarative deployments

Automated reconciliation

Safer, auditable releases

5️⃣ Kubernetes Deployment

Application runs as a Kubernetes Deployment

Environment variables are injected securely via Kubernetes Secrets

Application is exposed using a LoadBalancer Service

Key features:

Scalable architecture

Secure configuration management

Cloud-provider-agnostic design

🔐 Security & Best Practices

✅ GitOps deployment model

✅ Secrets stored outside source control

✅ Immutable Docker images

✅ Commit-based deployment history

✅ Easy rollback via Git revert

🚀 Why This Project Matters


This project demonstrates hands-on experience with:

Modern CI/CD automation

Cloud-native application deployment

Kubernetes and GitOps workflows

Real-world DevOps tooling used in production environments

It is designed to showcase job-ready DevOps skills, not just theoretical knowledge.

📈 Future Improvements

Add Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

Integrate monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

Implement blue/green or canary deployments

Add security scanning in CI (Trivy, Snyk)

📌 Summary

This repository showcases a complete end-to-end DevOps CI/CD pipeline for an e-commerce application, built using industry-standard tools and best practices.
